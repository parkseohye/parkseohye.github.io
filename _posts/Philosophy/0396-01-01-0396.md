§ The higher the topic, the higher it is

<br>

## **Philosophy**

**1.** Nature is always repetitive and regular. So even if you follow only one thread, there is a possibility of reaching the truth.

<br>

**2.** The perfect system itself is not perfect. Because there is no maintenance system in it. If someone makes a maintenance system, then there is another problem, which is a waste of resources.

> ⑴ Karl Popper **:** The knowledge system should be built on the basis of constant rebuttals rather than perfect proofs.

> ⑵ PSYCHO-PASS Animation **:** A complete and perfect society is an illusion.

> ⑶ It has been mathematically proven by Goedell's theorem of imperfections.

> ⑷ In conclusion, if knowledge is not constantly modified after organizing it once, the knowledge is incomplete.

<br>

**3.** A stable system does not save the loser. So, paradoxically, a stable system is unstable.

> ⑴ Similarly, stable systems do not respond wisely to unexpected uncertainties.

> ⑵ Election causes political instability, which in turn stabilizes society paradoxically.

<br>

**4.** **Justice** is to minimize the total amount of contradictions in society. This concept varies depending on the society and puts emphasis on social stabilization.

> ⑴ Affected by Kantianism.

> ⑵ Justice is **objective** because the contradiction is objective, logically and mathematically.

> ⑶ Justice is flexible because the concept varies from group to group.

> ⑷ Justice is moral because it seeks to stabilize society.

> ⑸ It is unjust to create contradictions to reduce contradictions. Therefore, excessive reform is also wrong.

> ⑹ Unjust groups cannot survive to the **theory of evolution**. 

<br>
<br>

## **Self-development**

**5.** A person lives to realize his or her self. 

<br>

**6.** People realize what they are good at by comparing themselves to others and establishing themselves.

<br>

**7\.** Being overproud is being overscarce.

<br>

**8.** Love must be eternal and superior.

> ⑴ Just as electromagnetic wave becomes complete as electric and magnetic fields complement each other, love will be such.

<br>

**9\.** A pessimist criticizes why there are no facts to criticize if there are no more facts to criticize.

> ⑴ Similarly, a pessimist criticizes a perfect person for lack of humanity.

<br>

**10.** The development of a person is also an example of punctuated equilibrium. It is called 'motive'.

<br>

**11.** Human growth is so great that it can even change causality or go against nature's providence.

> ⑴ However, nature and God are always great.

<br>

**12.** Picasso is said to have already completed the painting level at the age of five. But isn't it that he's interested in Cubism that the well-drawn masterpieces are too obvious and there's no new area to try?

<br>

**13.** By entropy, this world is not a good environment to bear lives. I think greed in people is the strength to survive and the motive to develop in this uncompromising world. So greed is not necessarily bad.

> ⑴ Love changes easily, but greed doesn't change. Therefore, you must mix greed in love not to make it changed.

> ⑵ However, there is no positive advantage in showing inferiority and envy to others.

<br>

**14.** Few people can confidently describe themselves as great people. But wouldn't you be able to confidently say you're a special person?

<br>

**15.** People who are thirsty for growth should never stop growing. Because the exploding energy will be directed at themselves.

<br>

**16.** If a special person doesn't want to be lonely, he or she has to make the world a better place and find someone who can admit the value you follow.

> ⑴ Eventually, only the unfortunate genius who knows the secrets of the world changes the world.

**17.** If you look forward to tomorrow when you close your eyes, isn't that happiness?

<br>

**18.** One should have a philosophy to build huge wealth. The reasons are as follows.

> ⑴ Because a greater value is needed, as it is not beneficial to society that social resources are concentrated on certain individuals.

> ⑵ Because justification is needed for those who may feel deprived and jealous when social resources are concentrated on specific individuals.

> ⑶ Because it needs a value that surpasses the violation of the anti-trust regulation act. 

<br>

**19.** At some point, I feel that my life is not my own. I won't live easily.

<br>

**20\.** A life with news is proof that you are well off.

<br>

**21.** Trust is a priceless resource. Once lost, you can never get it back.

<br>

**22.** I'm not superior to others. I'm just more angry than others. 

<br>
<br>

**Imperial study**

**23\.** The paradox of a dictator

> ⑴ Since the benefits of political power are concentrated only on a few, the dictator basically causes the majority's discontent.

> ⑵ The reason why a dictator takes the path of a war monarch is to resolve people's dissatisfaction through economic growth.

> ⑶ However, there is a way to become a technological powerhouse in addition to becoming a war monarch.

<br>

**24.** The king must be lonely.

> ⑴ First, it is because it is always lonely to pioneer a new paradigm and a new market.

> ⑵ Second, it is because only those who walk lonely paths can win public support.

> ⑶ Third, the king is not a job, but a sudden fate.

> ⑷ So if you're lonely, you're also walking the path of a king.

<br>

**25.** The king is special.

> ⑴ The king is neither a lawyer nor a doctor. The king is a king.

> ⑵ The king must meet the queen.

> ⑶ There are not many kings. Perhaps there cannot be more than one king in a kingdom as there cannot be two suns in a sky.

> ⑷ And kings are those who walk on paths that no one has ever walked on and go on paths that no one has ever reached.

<br>

**26.** There are three kinds of kings in the world.

> ⑴ A king who rules the people with authority and power.

> ⑵ A king with a free soul.

> ⑶ A king supported by all people.

**27.** Change always comes from the outside.

<br>

**28.** It's not a here if one didn't have a crisis.

<br>

**29.** Leaders with poor background build leadership based on strong will. And it's superior.

<br>

**30.** The world is well-made. In the end, those who walk on an unnamed path dominate the world.

> ⑴ One Piece Animation **:** The world is well-made. Like Roger wasn't a man of ability.

<br>

**31\.** A lot starts to be seen when authority is laid down.

<br>

**32.** Rather than forcing beliefs, it is desirable to spread them according to market principles.

<br>

**33.** Those who choose to believe in their philosophys should be rewarded.

<br>

**34.** God is one, and there are only several representatives of God.

<br>
<br>

**Social science**

**35.** There are three reasons why people need society.

> ⑴ First, a newborn child cannot live without parents.

> ⑵ Second, people have instincts like social animals.

> ⑶ Third, people belonging to a group are stronger than people who do not belong to a group.

<br>

**36.** Identifying wrongdoing reduces contradictions within a group, but we should be cautious as it can undermine the stability of the group.

> ⑴ It is wrong to be absolutely zero tolerance for wrongdoing because people can make mistakes.

> ⑵ There are more adults who make wrongdoings than you think. Because adults no longer believe in the values they believed in when they were young.

> ⑶ However, it is unjust to make contradictions to reduce contradictions. Therefore, excessive reform is also wrong.

> ⑷ The more principled a manager is, the healthier the organization is. This is because contradictions of the group are reduced and there is no harm to the stability of the group.

<br>

**37.** Learning is divided into science and art. A study of humanities is involved in art. 

<br>

**38.** Social science is the science of responsibility because it is related to consensus and policy, and natural science is the science of humility because it is related to objectivity.

<br>

**39.** I am politically neutral. However, voting is mandatory for me.

> ⑴ **Reason 1.** It is inefficient if the scientific and industrial sectors that require large investments are unnecessarily dominated by political pressure.

>> ① However, this reason does not seem to apply much to Elon Musk. Earlier this year, he saw President Biden intentionally passing Tesla Motors in the electric vehicle market and tweeted in anger to drive out Joe Biden, which does not seem to shake Elon Musk's position.

>> ② The reason why the U.S. raised Elon Musk and still does not restrict him is that Elon Musk can realize the infinite glory of the U.S. What you learn from history is that there is always a phase of decline when you have your heyday. However, if the U.S. monopolizes several planets alone, the U.S. potential will exceed that of all other countries. The reason why it is expressed as 'potential' here is that the United States will not unnecessarily stimulate competitors. 

> ⑵ **Reason 2.** Real politics, after all, is self-contradictory.

> ⑶ **Reason 3.** Only those who form a new force can eventually pioneer a new paradigm and a new market.

> ⑷ For this, I should aim for the future rather than the present for political neutrality.

>> ① However, some dreamers and thinkers go to extremes because they are far from reality. 

> ⑸ For this, I should aim for integration rather than division.

<br>

**40\.** The roles of politicians are largely classified in two ways.

> ⑴ Decrease of social conflict costs

> ⑵ Guarantee of one's right to life

**41\.** I think politics and history are examples of punctuated equilibrium. Therefore, an attitude to explain history by dividing it into a specific period rather than a continuous flow is reasonable.

<br>

**42.** The reason why economics uses the concept of opportunity cost is that the idea that I'm doing this for this little money inhibits the industry.

⑴ Opportunity cost means the most valuable thing that you have given up for a choice. The reason why economics uses the concept of opportunity cost is that the idea that I'm doing this for this little money inhibits the industry. Obviously, all people's activities will have similar economic importance if they develop to a high level, but because of the logic of comparative advantage by opportunity cost, investment or development is focused on only areas that prosper at the moment.

<br>

**43.** The hierarchy of jobs causes social discontent. That is the driving force behind enterpreneurs with unnamed jobs.

<br>

**44.** A nation is a unit that maximizes economies of scale by sharing languages, history, culture, and industry. At the same time, it is a huge group that creates a sense of belonging, identity, and an evironment where people can live like humans.

<br>

**45.** There may be a moment when you have to seriously think about a company without employees, a school without students, and a country without population.

<br>

**46.** A healthy industry should be in a form where both skilled and unskilled workers can participate.

> ⑴ That is the case with the automobile industry.

> ⑵ The IT industry consists of 100% skilled workers, which is believed to have an inherent problem.

<br>
<br>

**Policy**

**47\.** There are three major problems in Korea.

> ⑴ Low birth rate of 0.82 per couple

> ⑵ The fact of the only divided country in the world

> ⑶ The highest plastic usage

<br>

**48\.** There are three main causes of low birth in Korea.

> ⑴ Population overcrowding due to the concentration of population in the capital area.

> ⑵ Increase of education cost.

> ⑶ A lack of impetus in economic growth.

> ⑷ A career break for women.

<br>

**49.** There are three main causes of low birth in Korea.

> ⑴ Local investment.

> ⑵ Development the ultimate and best knowledge system. 

> ⑶ Promotion of new industries.

> ⑷ Transition of childcare teachers to public officials and national guarantee of infant education facilities attached to the workplace.

<br>

**50.** Innovation is a game making losers.

<br>
<br>

**History science**

**51.** The Korean people are those who have never invaded. So it is a special and chosen people, especially in the globalized world.

<br>
<br>

**Futurology**

**52.** There are three reasons why K-content is currently popular in OTT (e.g., Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney Plus, Amazon Studios, etc.).

> ⑴ Because the Korean people have a 'good' image as non-invasion people.

> ⑵ Because Korea has freedom of thought; the impetus seems to come from the overwhelming distribution of IT devices.

> ⑶ Because Korea has experienced a rapid economic rise, giving a sense of homogeneity to developed countries and a sense of reverence to underdeveloped countries.

<br>

**53.** The next-generation innovative science field is diagnosed with five as follows:

> ⑴ IT

> ⑵ Bio

> ⑶ Environment

> ⑷ Space

> ⑸ Quantum **:** quantum computers, fusion power, particle physics

<br>

**54\.** Giant industries are linked to human desires.

> ⑴ The field of IT is linked to entertainment.

> ⑵ The field of law is linked to frequent disputes between people.

> ⑶ The field of medicine is linked to the desire to live a healthy and long life.

> ⑷ The field of beauty is linked to the desire to be superior to others.

> ⑸ The field of space is linked to pure curiosity. So I think it's a special industry.

<br>

**55.** In the past, it is said that birds listen to day words and rats listen to night words. But the strange thing is, these days there are no birds or mice.

<br>

**56.** There are four reasons why eco-friendly energy is important.

> ⑴ Now, the Russian-Ukraine war has threatened that Russia will not supply the world with energy. In the end, it is necessary to realize energy independence from the standpoint of energy security.

> ⑵ There has been some consensus that the global environment is destroyed by people. Eco-friendly marketing certainly works, and no one can easily refute it even if they set up trade barriers with emphasis on the environment.

> ⑶ The unit price of eco-friendly energy production continues to fall. In 100 years, all energy will be used as eco-friendly energy, so shouldn't we consider switching to eco-friendly energy from now on?

> ⑷ Green energy emphasizes scientific capabilities compared to other types of energy. Therefore, there is a high possibility that new industries will grow or start-ups and star entrepreneurs will emerge. There's already Solar City, as well, and it shows us that the focus on private enterprises rather than governments promotes job creation and huge economic growth. It also means that there are many things to study scientifically, so it can create other value-added industries.

<br>

**57.** Ten years from now, SpaceX's Starship reaches Mars. ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fxaAENrZYw)) What do we have to prepare for that?

> ⑴ **Topic 1.** Microbiome

>> ① There's no better way to make Mars a viable planet than microbes.

>> ② In fact, it was a microbe called cyanobacteria that generated oxygen on Earth when there was no oxygen in the air.

> ⑵ **Topic 2.** Agriculture 

>> ① It is important to exploit resources on Mars, and it seems more realistic to transport organic materials than heavy metals by spaceships.

>> ② Organic materials can be used as food, but it can also be used as an energy source.

>> ③ Energy source is important because they can be sold on Earth or used for spaceships.

>> ④ To realize such agriculture, completely unmanned agriculture and plants growing on Mars will become a hot topic.

> ⑶ **Topic 3.** Wouldn't a city on Mars declare an independent state?

> ⑷ **Topic 4.** Why the U.S. raised Elon Musk and he is still not constrained

>> ① Elon Musk can make America's infinite glory come true.

>> ② What you learn from history is that there are always stages of decline when there is a golden age.

>> ③ But Mars exploration is a game changer that can change the corollary of history.

>> ④ However, space industry competition will be triggered due to China and Russia, and the risk of war may increase.

>> ⑤ In the meantime, space scientists may be making a lot of money.

<br>

**58.** Science is a virtue of openness, but technology is a virtue of protection
