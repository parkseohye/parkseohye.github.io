Knowledge must be equal
</center>
<br> 

## 1. Before entering,

This is a blog that started out as a diary (since 2009). However, through this blog, I became special and I wanted to communicate with the world through this blog.Then, while watching the match between Lee Se-dol and AlphaGo in 2016, I wanted to sketch a tree about human knowledge on this blog.And now, I would like to complete this project in earnest.

#### Mission 1. Realize the democratization of knowledge

> ○ Because education is no longer equal...

> ○ Because education no longer shows hope and dreams...

> ○ A new change in Korea that is getting sick...

>> ○ People often get frustrated because they find it difficult to study or spend a lot of time unnecessarily.

>> ○ There were many cases where I didn't fully enjoy the pleasure of satisfying my desire for knowledge.

>> ○ Strong measures are taken because enormous educational expenses make Korea sick.

>> ○ By the way, will Korea's enthusiasm for education be lowered even if the final and best knowledge system for all fields is disclosed?

> ○ Advice from Avocado Addict

>> In an era where AI dominates AI, the collapse of capitalism will accelerate and return to a self-sufficient society will proceed. For those who are lagging behind this era, democratization of knowledge is essential.

<br>

#### Mission 2. prevention of human cognitive saturation

> ○ The arrival of singularity: It is expected that the speed at which knowledge accumulates will be faster than the speed at which mankind understands it in the next 50 years.

> ○ Information expansion: There is still concern about explosive growth of IT and bio information.

>> ○ Prevention of saturation of IT information: To cooperate with the IT industry

>> ○ Prevention of saturation of bio-information: To cooperate with the research community.expect to establish a gene-centered system

> ○ How can one person collect all the knowledge of mankind?

> ○ Answer 1. Crowd sourcing model: Build a business model for collecting and sharing knowledge by the majority

>> ○ The most important conclusion you will find while studying economic history.The world has always demonstrated the law of stagnant harvests.The increase in population led to irreversible technological development and people's lives became richer.Then, the more knowledge you share, the more people gather, and the more knowledge you gather, the more knowledge you create?

>> ○ Currently, known BM models such as Wikipedia, Github, and Naver Knowledgein are well known.

> ○ Answer 2. AI Artificial Intelligence Model: An idea of living and evolving writing

>> ○ What I'm going to write is not a typical sentence.So I won't take away the jobs of writers.

> ○ Answer 3. Social networking model: Building a network in the form of a point organization

>> ○ The business model I think of is a form of branch organization.The vertical class adopted by large companies is a diagnosis that is not suitable for modern times when individuals' desire for self-realization has become stronger.We are planning a strategy in which one person becomes the center of networking by forming a one-on-one private contract rather than a vertical class.This is what I saw and felt at the startup that I was with from the beginning to the listing.

> ○ Answer 4. Insights on Knowledge

>> ○ The core concept is based on the fact that there is a small percentage of the total knowledge.

>> ○ You can think of the contents of the core concept as a point note for studying for the exam.

>> ○ To understand the exact definition of the core concept, refer to the [surprisal](https://nate9389.tistory.com/2145#:~:text=%E2%91%A1%C2%A0uncertainty%20%EB%98%90%EB%8A%94-,surprisal,-%E2%97%8B%20%EC%A0%95%EC%9D%98%20%3A%20%EC%A3%BC%EC%96%B4%EC%A7%84%20%EA%B2%BD%EC%9A%B0%EC%9D%98) of information theory.

<br>

#### Mission 3. Attempt to preserve human knowledge

> ○ Immediately after the collapse of the ancient Roman Empire, the vast technology possessed by the Roman Empire was lost.

> ○ Humans are always facing extinction scenarios with high probability

>> ○ Climate change

>> ○ Nuclear war

>> ○ Asteroid collision

>> ○ Infectious disease outbreak

> ○ The current blog has the nature of an attempt to preserve human knowledge when human knowledge is lost.

<br>
<center>
Annie Dr. Stone also showed me a similar idea.
Figure. 1. Annie Dr. Stone Illustration
</center>
<br>

>> ○ As the teaching of the blockchain teaches, sharing knowledge makes knowledge forever.

>> ○ Of course, we will definitely prevent the extinction of mankind and share scenarios in preparation for this.

>> ○ Planning a complete and flawless data storage so that alien civilization can follow human knowledge in the distant future.

> ○ Or the process of preparing the seeds of knowledge to start civilization on another planet.

>> ○ In other words, don't you need an encyclopedia of all things when you build civilization on an alien planet in hundreds of years?

<br>

#### Mission 4. Accelerating Knowledge Acquisition

> ○ The tempo of music is fast, and fast and repetitive videos like TikTok become popular, so wouldn't it be future-oriented to quickly acquire knowledge?

> ○ Low birth rate is a phenomenon experienced by all developed countries. In an era when a few have to support the majority, the pace of knowledge acquisition must be accelerated.

<br>
<br>

## 2. Initiative 1. Future Posting/Project Progress Plan

> ○ '22. Translation project in October, publishing the second part of biology, and solving chemical and organic chemical requests.

> ○ Computer vision in November, 22. (Difficulty: Higher)

> ○ "December, 22.Korean Language Teacher Certificate, English Translation of Biology

> ○ 절차23. January visa issuance procedures, etc.

> ○ "February, 23."The law must be equal in front of everyone" project commenced: Visualizing the connection between legal provisions.

> ○ Participated in the AI Challenge in April, 23.

<br>
<br>

## 3. Initiative 2. content acquisition-related

#### 2-1. AI+Database(not started)

> AlphaFold2 database released in July 2022.With about 200 million protein structure databases, it has produced 1,000 times more protein structures in a year than humans have experimentally discovered in 50 years.Isn't AI's generation of vast amounts of data beyond the cognitive level a way to eventually move forward in acquiring content?And isn't the database for managing and withdrawing it important?I think that will be the final form of this blog.

<br>

#### 2-2. Next Generation Search Engine Project(not started)

> I don't think we can create content for all areas here.This is because 1) securing expertise that exceeds all experts in each field is almost impossible at the moment, 2) even if it is possible through artificial intelligence, it is not desirable to threaten existing jobs without fostering new industries, and 3) dealing with all deep concepts can greatly damage beginners' understanding.

> So the strategy I chose is 1) focusing on gathering relatively easily crawled knowledge (2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5), 2) focusing on building search engines that connect expert knowledge (2-6), 3) applying crowdsourcing (2-7).

> Unlike traditional search engines with graph-structured data structures and list-structured Wikipedia, this search engine is differentiated by its knowledge management system (KMS) with tree structures.I personally think the tree structure is the most similar to the human cognitive structure.Also, we are considering a private KMS that provides KMS to the company or a window that promotes government policies by providing KMS to the government.I think we need a "real" guide for hitchhikers traveling in the Milky Way...This will help 1) acquire knowledge quickly, 2) ensure the integrity of knowledge (the consistent nature of grammar and content) and non-redundant (the nature that allows only the necessary level of concept overlap), 3) communicate within the company, and 4) facilitate comparison of patent claims.

> What I felt while working together from the start-up to listing is that it is more difficult than I thought to maintain the integrity of the integrity of knowledge.In this regard, I observed that 1) the results of data analysis on different days should not be different, but I didn't know what parameters made them different when they were different, 2) communication between experts in different fields was poor, and 3) only the first time I knew what knowledge was new to me. And regarding 3), I have recorded a lot of new knowledge since I was quite young, so I was able to build a tree at the current level, but people who know too much may not know what new knowledge is.

<br>

#### 2-3. Evolving and Living AI (not started)

> ○ Basic idea

>> ○ Humans eat with their mouths like animals, but unlike animals, they eat knowledge with their heads.

>> ○ Just as food must be broken down into monomers to digest food, it must be broken down into concepts to digest writing.

>> ○ Of course, the context of the relationship between sentences is not meaningless, but it is meaningful to make the concept more clear.

>> ○ Just as living things constantly metabolize and evolve, knowledge must be alive and able to evolve.

> ○ Derivative idea 1. A model that crawls knowledge on its own (not started)

>> ○ Premise: The knowledge system has the existing integrity, non-redundancy, unity, and brevity.

>>> ○ Integrity: The nature of the content without errors

>>> ○ Non-redundant: Properties that do not overlap more than necessary

>>> ○ Integrity: The nature of a vast amount of text being connected to a single flow

>>> ○ Simplicity: The characteristic of the style being simple without any unnecessities.

>> ○ Step 1. sentence-by-sentence

>> ○ Step 2. Summarize only sentences that you can understand yourself: Don't ignore them collectively because they have directive pronouns (e.g., ", ", ", ").

>> ○ Step 3. Summarize only sentences about core concept

>> ○ Step 4. allocation by field: law, economy, science, etc.

>> ○ Step 5. Connect to specific posting in each field: Posting is often integrated within each field.

>> ○ Step 6. Connect the specific number of lines in each post: Insert the corresponding core knowledge at that point if there is no duplication.

>> ○ Interim conclusion: Again, the knowledge system has integrity, non-redundancy, unity, and brevity.

>> ○ Final conclusion: The knowledge system has integrity, non-redundantness, unity, and brevity forever (Mathematical induction)

> ○ Derivative idea 2.Digest Wiki Project

>> In 2-1, Wikipedia was chosen as the number one target in relation to gathering knowledge that can be crawled relatively easily. A sudden thought came to mind with the end of the translation project.For example, the word myofrontal carcinoma is used in English.Agrobacterium tumefaciensIf anyone is curious about Agrobacterium tumefaciens, please use the search engine in my blog. DNA technologyIt could be an influx of posts related toHe will then be able to identify which subcategories specifically include the word Agrobacterium tumefaciens in the DNA technology posting, and to some extent answer his questions.After all, what people are curious about is information, what I can provide is contextual information, and the means of attracting people is probably terminology.The work of crawling all the pages of the Wiki project and securing a set of jargon dictionaries will begin shortly.

> ○ Strategy

>> ○ How to create a programmable website using GitHub

>> ○ We plan to create an English website through the translation pipeline and try new things on GitHub.

<br>

#### 2-4. Laws are equal in the presence of all. (not started)

> The law must not only have equal effects, but also equal interests.ideas conceived for the legal maturity of all mankind.We can secure all legal documents in our country through the National Legal Information Center, and in this way, we can secure all legal documents around the world.In addition, collecting all the citation provisions in the provisions will ensure the interconnection of all legal texts, that is, the network.Then, if you run the clustering algorithm, you will have the appropriate hierarchy.This will make it easier for anyone to quickly understand legal knowledge.

</center>
<br>

<center>
  Figure. 2. The results of clustering that can be easily implemented in R
</center>
<br>

> ○ There are 1,580 laws in Korea (as of 2022), and there may be constitution, orders, ordinances, and rules, so thousands of posts will be created.

> ○ The laws of the United States vary from state to state, so...

> ○ Derivative Idea 1. Wouldn't it be possible to secure a hierarchy of the current blog's knowledge system if we secure a network of posts based on the link between posts?Ideas that form the basis of the following "how to present the blueprint of human knowledge in tSNE"

<br>

#### 2-5. Book Network

> The volume of books is too large.If I cluster all the books, can I know which one is more important and which one should I read first?

<br>

#### 2-6. OCR (image to text) (complete)

> It has already been implemented in GOONO, so I will borrow it.This makes it easy to convert image data and publications into digital data.

<br>

#### 2-7. Industry Standardization System (in progress)

> It is to link the data of the top experts in each field to establish industry standards.Who the first experts are selected will follow internal evaluation and will change over time.It will have an exclusive function similar to a patent and will be submitted to obtain industry standards.

<br>

#### 2-8. Consulting Services (in progress)

> Many teachers have already provided useful questions and materials.However, in general, I can see that both my client and I can communicate a lot of information through questions.1) It is different from conventional consulting services in that it is difficult to ask around as an adult, and 2) that respondents may be able to answer as soon as possible (compared to Naver Knowledgein).Please feel free to ask me any questions.

<br>
<br>

## 4. Initiative 3. Regarding image creation

#### 3-1. 3D Images as Contents(not started)

> Some of the images posted on this blog will be reborn as 3D images.The era has finally come when it is possible to recreate 3D images through multiple 2D images through AI algorithms.

<br>

<br>

#### 3-2 Resolution of Copyright Disputes(not started)

> In addition, the era has come when it is possible to reconstruct the existing image into the style you want.Through this, it is expected to post a more appropriate image and resolve much of the copyright-related disputes.

<br>

 <br>
  
#### 3-3. Image restoration(not started)

> If the above discussion is extended further, it may be difficult for some images, regardless of copyright, to have watermarks or unnecessary characters, even though their quality is quite good.In this case, it will be possible to restore the part we want by utilizing the deep image prior (DIP).

<br>

<br>

<center>

</center>
<br>
  
#### 3-4. Copyright detour strategy through image watermark development(not started)

> According to Article 102 Subparagraph 4 of the Copyright Act, "an act of making it possible to know the location of information and communication network works through information search tools" is not considered a copyright infringement.As a result, search engine platforms such as Google and Naver will be able to freely display images from copyright infringement.If you develop a technology that automatically watermarks images by displaying links to the original text of images and downloading them, uploading images to blogs can be free from copyright law.

<br>
<br>

## 5. Initiative 4. complete translation project

> ○ Limits of the Korean language market

>> 70 million Korean speakers worldwide. The world's population is 7 billion. Translation projects will be essential to ensure all 100x the benefits.We are planning a project in which when a post in a particular language is modified in Real-time, all other languages are modified.

> ○ declaration of completion of a project

>> The translation project was completed through five steps: html parsing → preprocessing → Naver Papago interworking → post-processing → simple correction of translation.I was very satisfied with the output, so I reviewed the patent application, but I decided to implement the know-how because I thought there was a possibility of a dispute with Naver Papago.As soon as the server is built, the program will be linked.

> ○ Example of translation

>> ○ Statistics Overview

>> ○ I' wouldn't an overly perfect translation system facilitate the outflow of domestic intellectual property overseas?

<br>
<br>

## 6. Initiative 5.publishing project (complete)

> ○ Growth of education market

>> The current market conditions are extraordinary.Southeast Asia and India have a large population of young people, but their educational level is very low.The demand for education in these regions is exploding, and in 10 years it will be a really remarkable market.And Africa.It is still undervalued, but the education market in 30 to 50 years is drawing attention.It is already well known that there are many negative factors in the domestic education market due to a lack of school-age population, and in the end, it would be the right direction to turn to overseas.Nevertheless, there is a great lack of means to look at market conditions.Therefore, I have adopted the publication of books as an indicator product to understand the atmosphere of the overseas education market.

> ○ Rediscovering the possibility of publication

>> There is a part of the resume (curriculum vitae, CV) that says Honor.Literally honorable performanceIt's the part where you write.To list such examples, there must be language, GPA, volunteer work, exchange students, and prize winners, among which papers and patents are the most powerful.In order to write a thesis, you must meet certain requirements under the professors who hold the academy, and to write a patent requires knowledge of patents, invention completion, and considerable cost.There is a third honor on par with papers and patents, and that is publishing.I think more people don't know this part than I thought.In the future, the paper market will decline and the electronic publishing market will rise.It's amazing that anyone can publish through the endless growth potential of the electronic publishing market and easy electronic publishing.

> ○ Festbook media(https://festbook.co.kr/)partnership with

>> By rediscovering the growth of the education market and the possibility of publishing, I sought out e-publishing partners and proceeded with publication through Festbook Media.It's not an exclusive contract, but I think it's a good condition, so I'm looking forward to signing a number of publishing contracts (~100 volumes).

> ○ Example of publications

>> ○ Organic and chemical bible you want you to know

>> ○ From the first step to the tenth step in statistics

>> ○ Biology as a whole - Microscopic understanding

<br>
<br>

## 7. Initiative 6. Apps on a Blog

#### 6-1. Not started

> My curiosity is also connected with social statistics.There is a limit to the literature to understand that.Therefore, we plan to activate the Quick Toolbar pop-up window to proceed with the survey.Besides, there's nothing much to do with the voting system.According to Mecalf's law, networks have a value proportional to their square.I think that theory can also be applied to YouTube and sites.I'd like to confirm that.

<br>

#### 6-2. Not started

> Wikipedia is a list, but knowledge must be sorted into trees. What if all knowledge is ordered?The knowledge that follows can only be explained by the knowledge in front.In that way, we can order all knowledge and create artificial intelligence that determines how many times that knowledge comes when new knowledge comes.That knowledge will automatically be placed in the right place, so that the machine can understand the new knowledge.If you have a sentence that says "A consists of B and C," you can place it right after the last of A, B, and C.It's going to take a lot of work.I'm not in a hurry right now.

<br>

#### 6-3. Automatically trimming the text(complete)

> It has already been implemented through Python.

<br>

#### 6-4.Image in-link (not started)

> ○ Example (www.creative-diagnostics.com)

<br>

#### 6-5. Simple Apps on a Blog (in progress)

> First of all, I plan to install a simple app on my blog.

> ✓Connecting a Neighbor Papago Link to a T-Story

> ✓ Hippocratic temperament test program

> ✓ Implementation of data calls from DB when entering text on a web page

> ✓ Implement interactive graphs on web pages using Node.js-based Bokeh

> ✓ statistical graph visualizer

> ✓ construction of a protein library through AlphaFold2

> ✗ Link to the wiki page: Go to the appropriate link, such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ [KEYWORD]

> ✗ A program that automatically shuffles tarot cards (planned)

> ✗ Various types of converters (planned): won-dollar exchange rate, etc.

> ✗ Web-based MBTI test (planned)

> ✗ A program that explains history on a 4D map (planned)

> ✗ Program for calculating the timing requirements of patents (planned)

<br>

#### 6-6. Database on a Blog (not started)

> ○ Method 1. It is not difficult at all if you install the dataset on the NAS and turn the corresponding url over to the blog.

> ○ Method 2. I'm seriously thinking about GitHub.

> ○ However, it is a question of which dataset to share.

> ○ Currently, the focus is on biological information data sets such as TCGA and GEO: A good example of UCSC Xena.

<br>

#### 6-7. How to present the blueprint of human knowledge in tSNE (not started)

> ○ https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/tsnemap/

## 8. Initiative 7. Human-Computer Interface (HCI)(not started)

#### 7-1 Acquisition of Knowledge

> What if you could organize all your knowledge?What if you could put VR devices into practical use?What if you could analyze brain waves through deep learning?You will be able to make a device that acquires knowledge just by wearing it on your head like a hat.

<br>

#### 7-2. Generation of Knowledge

> If the above discussion is expanded, it will be possible to create a device that secures the person's knowledge system just by writing it on the head.Wouldn't it be possible to realize human immortality or human computerization?

<br>

#### 7-3. Reorganization of Human Personality

> If you have an encyclopedia of search engines and everything, you can track the content that a particular individual reads, and you can implement the schema in that person's head.

<br>
<br>

## 9. Initiative 8.philosophy of knowledge

> ○ Idea 1. You can give order to all knowledge.

> ○ Idea 2. P vs NP problem.Proving that the problem is an easy one without solving it.Based on my experience, solving problems and checking are completely separate processes, but are these two really connected?If we finish worrying about knowledge, we can solve this problem.Is it possible to solve such a problem in the first place?

<br>
<br>

## 10.closing

> I want to build a Tower of Knowledge.

> I will climb to the top of the world and wait for you there.
